# Quick QA Log - [Session Description]
**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Focus:** Category system implementation + security validation

---

## üéØ Features Implemented
‚úÖ User-defined categories - Professional customization vs predefined options
‚úÖ Encrypted category storage - Categories stored securely like journal data
‚úÖ Category ComboBox UI - Clean selection interface in editor
‚úÖ Custom category dialog - User can create new categories on-demand

---

## üîç QA Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue 1: MVVM Framework Warnings
**Problem:** [ObservableProperty] used incorrectly on CategoryService
**Detection:** Build warnings MVVMTK0034
**Fix:** Changed to private readonly CategoryService _categoryService
**Learning:** Service dependencies shouldn't be observable properties

### Issue 2: Avalonia Control Property Error
**Problem:** `IsEditable="True"` not supported on ComboBox in Avalonia  
**Detection:** AVLN:0004 build error  
**Fix:** Removed unsupported property  
**Learning:** Cross-platform UI frameworks have different control capabilities

### Issue 3: Hardcoded Category Creation
**Problem:** "+ New" button created generic "New Category" instead of allowing custom names  
**Detection:** Manual UI testing  
**Fix:** Implemented `CategoryInputDialog` for user input  
**Learning:** UI placeholders need real functionality for professional tools

---

## üîí Security Validation Confirmed
‚úÖ **Categories encrypted**- Same AES-256 protection as journal entries
‚úÖ **Local storage only** - Categories stay on device like all sensitive data
‚úÖ **Debug output clean** - No category data leaked in logs

---

## üö® Network Issues Identified
**Issue type:** Pi server connection timeouts and route failures  
**Status:** Login errors (`No route to host (192.168.88.244:8000)`, `HttpClient.Timeout`). Not blocking development‚Äîlocal-first architecture is functioning as intended.  
**Next:** Investigate Pi network configuration in a future session

---
## üìä Progress Metrics
**Build cycles:** 3 successful  
**New files created:** 2 (dialog view and code-behind)  
**Core functionality:** Category system 80% complete  
**Security:** No regressions; encryption working properly

---
## üéØ Next Session Priorities
**1. Complete category filtering** - Enable filtering of journal entries by selected category  
**2. Category management UI** - Add features to edit and delete existing categories  
**3. Input validation** - Strengthen security checks for category input to prevent malicious content  
**4. Pi network debugging** - Investigate and resolve server connection and timeout issues

## üí≠ QA Thinking This Session

**What went well:**
- Local-first architecture ensured uninterrupted development despite network issues.
- Security validation was seamlessly integrated during feature implementation.

**What I learned:**
- MVVM service injection requires careful adherence to framework guidelines.
- UI control capabilities can differ significantly across cross-platform frameworks.

**Questions for next time:**
- What is the most secure and user-friendly way to validate category input against malicious content?
- Which UX pattern best supports editing and managing existing categories?

**If asked in interview:** *"Tell me about a time you had to debug framework-specific issues."*  
**Answer:** "While building a category system in Avalonia, I faced framework-specific challenges such as MVVM property warnings and unsupported ComboBox properties. I identified each issue through build errors, consulted documentation, and implemented targeted fixes like custom dialogs, ensuring robust and maintainable solutions."

**Overall Assessment:** Solid progress on professional categorization system. Local-first architecture proving its value with network issues not blocking core functionality.
