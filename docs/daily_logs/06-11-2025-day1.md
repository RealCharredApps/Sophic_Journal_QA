# Biggest Update // only the beginning

Sophic Development QA Log
Date: June 11, 2025
Project: Sophic Journal App (Avalonia MVVM + WavyGravy API)
ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision Achieved

Philosophy-focused journal app - Clean, distinguished UI that makes users feel like thoughtful philosophers
Cross-platform capability - Avalonia foundation ready for macOS, Windows, iOS
Source Serif 4 font consideration - Typography to enhance philosophical writing experience
Jordan Peterson-inspired respect - UI treats users as articulate, thoughtful individuals

âœ… Major Milestones Completed
Backend Infrastructure (WavyGravy API)

SQLite database migration - Successfully upgraded from JSON to proper database
Performance monitoring - Auto-restart, temperature alerts, backup automation
Security hardening - SSH keys, firewall, rate limiting, JWT authentication
Auto-deployment - One-command updates from git with health checks

Frontend Core (Sophic App)

MVVM architecture - Proper separation of concerns with ViewModels
Full-screen editor - Distraction-free writing experience
Entry card system - Clean list view with clickable navigation
Brand colors implementation - Sophisticated teal/sage palette (#50797D, #BAD4D5, etc.)

ðŸš¨ Critical QA Issues Identified
Development Process Issues

Multiple instances of rushing to complex solutions without testing basics first
Binding complexity - Over-engineering XAML bindings when simple code-behind works
Event subscription errors - Fundamental mistakes in MVVM event handling
Time waste - 30+ minutes lost on preventable errors

Technical Debt

UI inconsistencies - TextBox black background on focus (partially resolved)
Missing API integration - No actual connection to WavyGravy backend yet
Incomplete CRUD - Delete functionality exists but needs trash system
No data persistence - Entries lost on app restart

ðŸŽ¨ UX/UI Feedback Captured
Positive Elements

Clean aesthetic - Users appreciate the philosophical, distinguished feel
Intuitive navigation - Entry cards â†’ full-screen editor flow works well
Meaningful content - Mock philosophical entries resonate with vision

Areas Needing Improvement

Editor styling - needs to be more intuitive
Hover states - Current black/gray not optimal, needs white-ish gray
Entry visibility - "All entries on main view have to show entire card on scroll"
Trash system - User wants proper deletion with 30-day cleanup cycle

ðŸ“‹ Technical Specifications Confirmed
Data Model
csharp- Id (int)
- Title (string)
- Content (string) 
- Tags (string?)
- Mood (string?)
- CreatedAt/UpdatedAt (DateTime)
- IsDeleted (bool) - for soft delete
UI Requirements

Single entry view - Full-screen writing, uninterrupted
Entry list view - Summarized cards with edit buttons
Rounded corners - Consistent 8-12px radius
No local storage - API-first approach with temporary cache only

ðŸš€ Next Sprint Priorities
P0 (Critical)

Connect to the API - get a real database started
Fix TextBox styling - White background, proper hover states
Implement trash system - Move to trash â†’ restore/permanent delete
API integration - Connect to WavyGravy backend for persistence
Entry card improvements - Better delete button placement

P1 (Important)

User settings/profile - Mentioned as requirement
Light/dark mode - System preference detection
Search functionality - Filter entries by content/tags
Export capabilities - Markdown/PDF output

P2 (Future)

Figjam-style whiteboard - Drawing features for visual thinking
QA exercises - Interactive philosophy prompts
Cross-platform optimization - iOS-specific considerations
Performance optimization - Large entry collections

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
User Priorities

Function over form - User values working features over perfect styling
Philosophical focus - Content and experience matter more than technical complexity
Professional expectations - Demands senior-level execution, no tolerance for basic mistakes
Practical workflow - Simple, intuitive interactions trump clever technical solutions

Development Approach

Test incrementally - Build â†’ test â†’ commit pattern works
Respect user time - 30 minutes wasted = significant frustration
MVVM done right - Events and bindings need careful consideration
Git workflow - Clean commits with meaningful messages

ðŸŽ­ Project Personality
Sophic successfully embodies its philosophical vision - the app feels distinguished, respectful, and encourages thoughtful reflection. The clean UI with sophisticated colors creates an environment where users feel like serious thinkers rather than casual note-takers.
