## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive security testing approach for Sophic Journal, a distributed personal data management system with enterprise-grade security requirements. Given the zero-trust architecture and privacy-first design, security validation is paramount to ensuring user data protection and system integrity.

**Security Testing Objectives:**

- **Validate authentication mechanisms** against bypass attempts
- **Verify data encryption** in transit and at rest
- **Assess input validation** and injection prevention
- **Evaluate session management** security controls
- **Test network security** configurations and monitoring

**Risk-Based Approach:** Testing prioritizes high-impact scenarios that could result in data breaches, unauthorized access, or privacy violations.
