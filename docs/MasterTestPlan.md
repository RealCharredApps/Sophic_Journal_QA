# Sophic Journal - Master Test Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**QA Engineer:** Justin Sjaaheim  
**Project Classification:** Distributed Personal Data Management System

-----

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive quality assurance strategy for Sophic Journal, a distributed journaling application designed with enterprise-grade security requirements. The system implements a zero-trust architecture where personal data never persists on client devices, requiring rigorous validation of authentication, data transmission, and user experience under various network conditions.

**Key Quality Objectives:**

- **Zero data breaches** during all testing phases
- **100% uptime** during normal operating conditions
- **Sub-2-second response times** for all user interactions
- **Graceful degradation** during network failures
- **Enterprise-grade security** posture validation

-----

## System Under Test Overview

### Application Architecture

**Sophic Journal** implements a client-server architecture with the following components:

**Client Application (Avalonia/C#):**

- Cross-platform desktop journaling interface
- Real-time mood tracking and reflection management
- Zero local data persistence (security requirement)
- Encrypted communication with remote API server

**Server Infrastructure (Raspberry Pi/Linux):**

- Headless API server with SSH/SSL dual authentication
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Secure data storage with encryption at rest
- Network isolation with firewall protection

**Communication Layer:**

- SSH key-based authentication for server access
- SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmission
- JSON-based API communication protocol
- Session management with configurable timeouts

### Critical Business Requirements

1. **Data Privacy:** No identifiable information stored on client devices
1. **Security:** Multi-layer authentication preventing unauthorized access
1. **Reliability:** System remains functional during network disruptions
1. **Performance:** Responsive user experience across all network conditions
1. **Scalability:** Architecture supports multiple concurrent users
